# Airsim-Drone-Simulation
1> This is the airsim drone simulation project using python, openCV etc <br>
2> In this project, if you draw anything on the paint, it means any shape such as triangle, rectangle, square, polygon etc. <br>
3> you need to have the following requirement to start this project. <br>

# Requirements
1> Install the unreal 2.4 -v because it support the airsim simulation world etc i don't know much about it just do it then read the article on that if you need more information ðŸ˜…. <br>
2> you need to have the vs -2019 -------- its not the normal one it have the purpul coluor icon. <br>
3> need to have anaconda install ---- mainly using the anaconda cmd to run this project. <br>
4> and lastly airsim need to be install. <br>

# what you need to do to run this project 
1> Install AirSim on your system. <br>
2> Install Unreal Engine 4.24. <br>
3>Navigate to:

AirSim\PythonClient\multirotor


Create a new folder (e.g., drone_formation_system). <br>
4> Copy the repository files into this new folder (drone_formation_system). <br>
5> Navigate to:

AirSim\Unreal\Environments\Blocks. <br>
6> Open and run the Blocks.uproject file. <br>
7> This will launch the Unreal Engine environment for simulation. <br> 
8> Click the Play button (top-right corner in Unreal Engine) to start the simulation. <br>
9> Open Anaconda Prompt (comes with Anaconda installation). <br>
10> Navigate to the folder where you saved the repo files:

cd AirSim\PythonClient\multirotor\drone_formation_system <br>
11> Activate your AirSim virtual environment:

conda activate airsimenv
 <br>
12> Run the program file for the simulation:

python main_controller.py <br>

13> Ensure the Blocks.uproject is running in the background and is in Play mode while executing the script.
