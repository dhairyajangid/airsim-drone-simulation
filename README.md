# Airsim-Drone-Simulation
1> This is the airsim drone simulation project using python, openCV etc <br>
2> In this project, if you draw anything on the paint, it means any shape such as triangle, rectangle, square, polygon etc. <br>
3> you need to have the following requirement to start this project. <br>

# Requirements
1> Install the unreal 2.4 -v because it support the airsim simulation world etc i don't know much about it just do it then read the article on that if you need more information ðŸ˜…. <br>
2> you need to have the vs -2019 -------- its not the normal one it have the purpul coluor icon. <br>
3> need to have anaconda install ---- mainly using the anaconda cmd to run this project. <br>
4> and lastly airsim need to be install. <br>

# what you need to do to run this project 
1> you need to have airsim install in your client. <br>
2> you need to have unreal 4.24 install in your client. <br>
3> after that go through this folters -> AirSim\PythonClient\multirotor and create new folder there name it what you like in my case i gave drone_formation_system. <br>
4> save these repo file there here in my case folder "drone_formation_system". <br>
5> after that you need to go through these folder -> AirSim\Unreal\Environments\Blocks. <br>
6> you need to run the block file that is .uproject <br>
7> In block (.uproject) file we can run the simulation here this is unreal environment for simulation. <br> 
8> to start the simulation there is play button on the right top side click on that button it will show for play <br>
9> you need to have the anaconda prompt if you have anaconda install you already have it. it basically the cmd for anaconda <br>
10> you need to go through the folder where you save the repo files AirSim\PythonClient\multirotor\drone_formation_system then you need to create the env file ex:- c: cd \AirSim\PythonClient\multirotor\drone_formation_system  conda activate airsimenv 
11> you need to activate like this as shown above it will activate the virtual environment for airsim
12> then you need to run the cmd ->  c:\AirSim\PythonClient\multirotor\drone_formation_system python main_controler.py by this it will run the program file for the simulation make sure that in background the block file is runing and also it in play mode
